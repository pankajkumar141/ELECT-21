The execution of the program written for “Elect21” is successfully done. 
The voter is successfully casting their votes to elected candidates. 
Live voting count after voting is successfully showing and leading candidate is successfully updating according to the vote count.
When we run the program, it will show the screen.

Here  we have given that the unique id should be between 1-10. It can be change accordingly. 

Now, suppose after voting once we went to vote again with the same unique id, then screen will be shown

The whole programming is done keeping in view of what voter will see on their screen which is frontend view.
We will keep updating the code in the near future as per the requirement. 
We can also show here the list of voter through their unique id which is subject to privacy. 
We can also include registration and login function in the near future for prior registration of voters
